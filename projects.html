                    <ul>
                        <li>Imported the library pynput into the code to allow the file to control and monitor devices when run.</li>
                        <li>
                            Scripted functions to create an empty text file that would iterate through each key that was recorded and have it logged in the text file. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Created separate functions with global values that would count the number of keys recorded and update the text file after a fixed number of keys were logged. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Tested the keylogger file in a Virtual Box environment without firewall protection to ensure functionality for both the code and the text file created within. 
                        </li>

                <h3>Python Password Checker - Personal</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Imported a file containing 10,000 commonly used passwords to compare user inputs and imported libraries to search for key words in the creation of user passwords.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created functions to present the user the option to either create their own password or have the program create a strong password automatically.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed scripts with if/else statements to serve as password verficiation checks that would accept or deny inputs based on if all requirments were met for password strength.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added a function to create a text document that would record generated passwords and user inputs that passed the checks and encrypt through a basic MD5 encryption.

                <ul>
                    <li>Created a remake of Space Invader with the design of Galaga.</li>
                    <li>Utilized Pygame and several libraries to create screeen displays, player models, enemy models, and lives.</li>
                    <li>
                        Scripted multiple functions to control player movement through keyboard bindings, bullet travel and velocity, enemy movement, collisions between bullets and enemies, collision between player and enemies, and player lives.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created pixel art for characters and imported .jpeg and .png files into the program for background customization and font styles.

                    <li>
                        Designed an IP Address Scheme and implemented VLANs and Trunking Protocols and assigned IP Addresses to each subnet and configured specific routers for Inter-VLAN routing.

                    <li>
                        Secured switch physical ports and configured OSPF and Extended ACLs to prevent guests on the network from connecting to the NTP/Syslog Server.
